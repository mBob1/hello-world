# hello-world
Just to train on something new
Cause I (Bob), need to understand by myself how to code properly, how to analyze huge amount of relevant (and nonrelevant) data but also how to do all of this efficiently + smartly (full appreciation of string and general relativity theories is planned as well but that's something else).
